# Words Organizer

**`WordsOrganizer`** is a ruby class that stores an array of words and can sort them all in alphabetical order by runing a method called **`sort_words`** that implements the `merge sort` algorithm.

>Merge sort is a sorting technique based on divide and conquer technique. With worst-case time complexity being ÎŸ(n log n), it is one of the most respected algorithms. Merge sort first divides the array into equal halves and then combines them in a sorted manner. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org)
